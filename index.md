## [Project 1: Indian Housing Price Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/loliamserious/SOEN6111-BIG-DATA)
* Analyzed 29451 lines of data and 12 influencing factors of Indian housing prices to help understand buyer behaviors through exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Forecasted Indian housing price with 0.05 RMSE and 64.3% R2 through implementation of random forest regressor and gradient-boosted regressor
* Extracted meaningful information from data through visualization of distribution and calculation of correlation using python, PySpark and pandas 
* Engineered features put on knowing inter-quartile range (IQR), PySpark, transformation, normalization, encoding and sklearn
* Optimized random forest regression and gradient-boosted regression model using GridsearchCV to reach the final result
